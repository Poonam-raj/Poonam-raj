# Hi I'm Poonam

My technical career of over three years has spanned the bootcamp space: creating technical curriculum, teaching coding concepts and building internal tools to meet business needs. In this time I've developed a deep knowledge of both web development and data engineering. In this time I also completed a level 5 Software Development qualification as an apprentice. 

Software Development skills include: JavaScript / TDD with Jest / Express Servers / Node / React framework / NextJS
Data Engineering skills include: Python / TDD with Pytest / FastAPI / AWS S3, CloudWatch, Lambda, IAM / Terraform / CICD with GitHub Actions

I am also a team lead with extensive experience as a scrum master leading ceremonies in our agile sprints.

Here are some examples of codebases I've produced either to stretch my technical chops, demonstrate coding concepts, or build tools to meet a need. 

**NC News Backend API**

Other bits and bobs:
